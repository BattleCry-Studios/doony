## Changes

- The fonts are bigger. Way bigger.
- More spacing in between list items.
- Removes a lot of the useless icons
- All jobs pages have a "Build Now" button to trigger a build
- Replaces Courier New with Consolas
- Hover menus have a pointer cursor, indicating clickability
- Text inputs are friendlier, bigger
- Builds are zebra-striped, have more padding

## Compatibility

This will "work" against the latest version of Jenkins, currently 1.532. It may
work with older versions but this is not guaranteed.
